## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by respect, professionalism, and inclusivity. By participating, you are expected to uphold these values. Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@lithiajs.com](mailto:support@lithiajs.com).

## Branch Strategy

Lithia uses a **canary development model** with release branches:

### Branch Overview

```
canary (default) → Active development, bleeding edge features
  ↓
v*.*.* → Release branches (e.g., v4.0.4)
  ↓
v*.*.* → Stable releases (tags)
```

### Branches Explained

- **`canary`** (default branch)
  - All active development happens here
  - All PRs should target this branch
  - Contains latest features and fixes
  - May contain bugs or breaking changes
  - Published as `lithia@canary` on npm

- **`v*.*.*`** (release branches)
  - Stable, production-ready code
  - Created from `canary` during releases
  - Used for final testing and bug fixes before release
  - Example: `v4.0.4` branch for version 4.0.4

- **`v*.*.*`** (tags)
  - Final stable releases
  - Created from release branches
  - Published as `lithia@latest` on npm
  - This is what users install by default

### For Contributors

**Always work from the `canary` branch:**

```bash
# Clone and switch to canary
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lithia.git
cd lithia
git checkout canary

# Create your feature branch from canary
git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature

# All PRs go to canary
```

### For Users

**Install stable version (recommended):**

```bash
npm install lithia
```

**Install canary version (for testing latest features):**

```bash
npm install lithia@canary
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Canary builds are experimental. Use in production at your own risk.

### Release Process

1. Development happens on `canary`
2. Features are tested by early adopters using `lithia@canary`
3. When stable, a release branch is created from `canary` (e.g., `v4.0.4`)
4. Final testing and bug fixes happen on the release branch
5. A tag is created from the release branch (e.g., `v4.0.4`)
6. The tagged version is published to npm as `lithia@latest`
7. Users get the update via `npm install lithia@latest`

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use TypeScript** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Strong typing** - Define interfaces for all data structures
- **No implicit any** - Always specify types

**Good:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  // implementation
}
```

**Bad:**

```typescript
async function getUser(id) {
  // implementation
}
```

### Code Style

We use **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for formatting:

```bash
# Format code
pnpm run format

# Check formatting
pnpm run format:check

# Lint
pnpm run lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm run lint:fix
```

### Best Practices

- **Self-explanatory code** - Code should be clear without excessive comments
- **Descriptive variable names** - Use clear, meaningful names
- **Small functions** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Error handling** - Always handle errors appropriately
- **Async/await** - Use async/await over promises
- **Immutability** - Prefer const over let, avoid mutations when possible

**Good:**

```typescript
async function getUserById(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {
  try {
    const user = await database.users.findById(userId);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to fetch user', { userId, error });
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Bad:**

```typescript
function getUser(id) {
  return db.users
    .find(id)
    .then((u) => u)
    .catch((e) => null);
}
```

### File Naming Conventions

- **kebab-case** for file names: `http-server-manager.ts`
- **PascalCase** for class names: `HttpServerManager`
- **camelCase** for functions and variables: `getUserById`
- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for constants: `MAX_BODY_SIZE`

# Test all functionality
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **JSDoc for public APIs** - Document all exported functions and classes
- **Type definitions** - Use TypeScript types as documentation
- **Clear naming** - Use self-explanatory names

**Example:**

````typescript
/**
 * Creates a new Lithia instance with the provided configuration.
 *
 * @param config - Lithia configuration object
 * @param opts - Configuration loading options
 * @param logger - Optional custom logger instance
 * @returns Promise resolving to configured Lithia instance
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const lithia = await createLithia({
 *   server: { port: 3000 }
 * });
 * ```
 */
export async function createLithia(
  config: LithiaConfig = {},
  opts: LoadConfigOptions = {},
  logger?: Logger,
): Promise<Lithia> {
  // implementation
}
````

```

### Common Issues

**Build fails with TypeScript errors:**

- Make sure you're on the latest `canary` branch
- Run `pnpm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date
- Check that your Node.js version is 18.x or higher

**Examples don't work:**

- Rebuild the main project: `pnpm run build`
- Reinstall example dependencies: `cd examples/1-basic-api && pnpm install`
- Clear any cached builds: `rm -rf dist`

**Hot reload not working:**

- Check file watcher limits on Linux: `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`
- Restart the dev server
